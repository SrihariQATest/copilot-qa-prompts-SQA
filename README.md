  - View attachments and requirements documentation

### General Requirements
- Basic understanding of testing methodologies compatible with SQA
- Familiarity with CSV format for test case management
- Knowledge of your application's business domain and workflows
- Understanding of SQA's automation capabilities and limitations

## Available Prompt Packs

### 1. **JIRA TestCase Generation Prompt** (`Jira_TestCase_Generation_Prompt.md`)
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive test cases from JIRA tickets and export them to CSV format compatible with SQA. Automatically adapts to generate API test cases when the JIRA ticket is about API functionality.
**Essential Requirements**:
- JIRA ticket access with detailed acceptance criteria
- Understanding of SQA CSV template structure for test case management
- Knowledge of positive/negative testing scenarios
- SQA test case import functionality

### 2. **Release Branch Impact Analyzer Prompt** (`Key_Impact_Analyzer_Prompt.md`)
**Purpose**: Compare two release branches to analyze code changes and their impact on existing regression test coverage. Generate comprehensive impact analysis and identify new test cases required for SQA execution.

**üîí READ ONLY ACCESS**: This analyzer will ONLY READ your code - NO commits, NO code changes, NO modifications will be made!

**üéØ What This Tool Does**:
- **Compares two release branches** to identify code differences
- **Analyzes impact** on existing regression test coverage  
- **Generates new test cases** in SQA-compatible CSV format
- **Provides risk assessment** and testing recommendations
- **Creates actionable reports** for QA teams

**üìÅ User-Friendly Input - Just Provide**:
```
Branch 1 (Base/Previous Release): [Folder Name]
Branch 2 (New/Current Release): [Folder Name] 
Regression Test File: [CSV File Name]
```

**üì§ Output Files Generated**:
1. **üìä Impact_Analysis_Report_[Timestamp].md** - Comprehensive impact analysis with specific affected test case IDs
2. **üìù New_Test_Cases_Impact_[Timestamp].csv** - New test cases in SQA-compatible format
3. **üìã Affected_Test_Cases_Summary.csv** - List of existing test case IDs that are impacted

**Essential Requirements**:
- Two release branch folders in your workspace (any naming convention)
- Existing regression test suite exported as CSV from SQA
- READ ONLY permission for code analysis (no modifications made)
- Understanding of SQA test case import functionality

### 3. **UI Object Extractor Prompt** (`UI_Object_Extractor_Prompt.md`)
**Purpose**: Extract UI elements and their properties (XPath, CSS selectors) in CSV format for new pages or enhanced features based on JIRA tickets and latest code.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Web Recorder Priority**: 
**Before using this Object Extractor prompt, always try Web Recorder first!** Web Recorder is much more efficient and should be your **primary method** for UI element extraction because:
- **Higher Accuracy**: Records actual browser interactions for precise element identification
- **Faster Extraction**: Automated capture vs manual coding
- **Multiple Attributes**: Automatically captures XPath, ID, CSS, class, text, and accessibility attributes
- **Real-time Validation**: Tests elements during recording for reliability
- **No Technical Expertise Required**: Point-and-click interface, no coding needed

**Use the Object Extractor prompt only when**:
- Web Recorder tool is not available
- Complex scenarios require manual analysis
- Code-level element extraction is needed

**Essential Requirements**:
- **Priority 1**: SQA Web Recorder tool access (recommended primary method)
- JIRA ticket details for new pages or feature enhancements
- Access to latest code repository with UI implementations (for manual extraction)
- SQA UI automation module and object repository access
- Understanding of DOM structure and element identification strategies

### 4. **Regression Scope Analysis Prompt** (`Regression_Scope_Prompt.md`)
**Purpose**: Analyze code changes in the latest branch and assess impact on existing regression test cases extracted from Simplify QA tool.

**üîí READ ONLY ACCESS**: This prompt only reads your code - NO commits, NO changes, NO modifications will be made!

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Default Naming Conventions:**
Before using this prompt, review and update the naming conventions if needed:
- **Module_Name**: Currently set to "test" for all test cases - change if your project uses different module names
- **Test Case Naming**: Uses "P_" prefix for positive tests and "N_" prefix for negative tests - modify if your organization uses different conventions

**What You Need:**
- **Latest Branch**: Your current code branch with recent changes
- **Regression Tests**: CSV/Excel file extracted from Simplify QA tool

**What It Does:**
- **Reads**: Latest code changes with existing regression test coverage (READ ONLY)
- **Analyzes**: Impact on current test cases from Simplify QA (READ ONLY)
- **Generates**: Updated regression scope in CSV format for SQA import
- **Prioritizes**: Critical vs. lower-priority test updates

**Essential Requirements**:
- READ ONLY access to latest code branch with recent changes
- Existing regression test cases exported from Simplify QA tool
- Understanding of code change impact on test coverage

## Why Use These Prompts?

- **Ready for SQA**: All outputs are in CSV format for direct SQA import
- **Save Time**: Automated test generation and impact analysis reduces manual work
- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI-powered mapping of code changes to specific test cases
- **User-Friendly**: Simple input requirements - just provide folder names and file names
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Detailed markdown reports with actionable recommendations
- **Risk Assessment**: Prioritized impact levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

- **Easy Integration**: Seamless workflow with SQA platform
- **READ ONLY Safety**: Impact analysis never modifies your code

## üéØ UI Element Extraction Priority

**For UI Object Extraction, always follow this order:**

1. **FIRST: Web Recorder** ‚≠ê (Much faster and more accurate)
2. **SECOND: Object Extractor Prompt** (Only when Web Recorder unavailable)

## Simple Workflow

1. **Choose your prompt** based on what you need:
   - **Test Generation**: JIRA TestCase Generation for new features
   - **Impact Analysis**: Release Branch Impact Analyzer for code changes
   - **UI Elements**: Object Extractor (try Web Recorder first!)
   - **Regression Scope**: Regression Scope Analysis for existing tests

2. **Gather your inputs**:
   - **For Impact Analysis**: Two branch folder names + regression CSV file
   - **For Test Generation**: JIRA tickets, requirements, etc.
   - **For UI Elements**: JIRA tickets + code access (or use Web Recorder)

3. **Provide simple context** - just tell the tool what you need:
   ```
   Hi! I need to analyze impact between Release_Branch_A and Release_Branch_B folders. 
   My regression test file is called Regression_80_Test.csv.
   ```

4. **Get comprehensive outputs**:
   - Detailed markdown reports with specific test case IDs
   - SQA-compatible CSV files ready for import
   - Risk assessments and actionable recommendations

5. **Import to SQA** and execute your optimized test strategy

## SQA Integration

### Test Management
- Import CSV files directly into SQA
- Organize by module and priority
- Track test results and reports

## Best Practices for SQA Integration

### **UI Element Extraction Best Practices**
- **Always use Web Recorder first** - It's significantly more efficient than manual extraction
- **Web Recorder captures more attributes** - Automatically records multiple locator strategies
- **Faster turnaround time** - Point-and-click vs manual coding and analysis
- **Higher reliability** - Real-time validation during element capture
- **Reserve Object Extractor prompt for special cases** - Complex scenarios or when Web Recorder unavailable

### Test Case Quality
- Review generated test cases for SQA compatibility
- Validate test data requirements and availability
- Ensure test cases are independent and executable in SQA
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across test suites

### Data Management
- Prepare test data suitable for SQA execution
- Ensure data privacy and security compliance
- Maintain test data freshness and relevance
